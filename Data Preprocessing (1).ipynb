    "In the column 'education' were duplicates values caused by a different type of cases. With the help of str.lower() method I succeded to get values without duplicates. Also there was interesting case in 'gender' column. There was one person who doesn't identify himsef with any gender. Renoving this row weren't right step, because I would lost a data from it, so I decided to replace it with majority gender Female, so it will not influence a lot at the all of data. In the column 'children' were weird values like 20 and -1. Analyzing the table I found impossible that people have 20 children in 21 years old, also -1 is not logical. Finding mean and median also brang no clean results, because median was 0 and it can impact on all of data if replace 20 children, also mean was 0.5 what was no good also. So I can assume that it was mistake and should be 2 and 1 children. Replaced 20 and -1 values with 2 and 1. Upon checking the 'children' column I noticed a value 0 in 'dob_years' column which is impossible. Calculating mean and median and decided to use median for replacement because mean was not integer value and we don't want float in our calculation."

    "In this project I had a data from bank and was needed to analyze and made a conclusion about credit score of clients. \n",
    "First of all I looked carefully on the DataFrame I have. The table consists from 12 columns and 21525 rows. Data types are float64 - 2 columns, int64 - 5 columns and object - 5 columns. On the first look the names of columns are normal without any anomalies. In this table there are few problems on the first look. I see missing values in columns 'days_employed' and 'total_income'. Since the amount of missing values for those columns is equal I can think that need to check connection between them. Also I can see non-logical values in the columns days_employed (negative values and too big values), children (negative values and too big(need to check)) and different case register in the 'education' column.\n",
    "First of all I checked missing values. I saw that the amount of missing values in columns 'days_employed' and 'total_income' are equal. I made a conclusion that there is connect between them. I made a conclusion that there are people who've never worked that why they don't have any income. In most cases it can be people who just turned on 21. I filtered results for 3 columns 'days_employed', 'total_income' and 'dob_years' and saw that missing values matched. Changed them to 0.\n",
    "In two columns 'days_employed' and 'total_income' there were values float64 type. I changed type to int64 and now we have valuse comfortable for math operations and comparing.\n",
    "In the column 'education' were duplicates values caused by a different type of cases. With the help of str.lower() method I succeded to get values without duplicates. Also there was interesting case in 'gender' column. There was one person who doesn't identify himsef with any gender. Renoving this row weren't right step, because I would lost a data from it, so I decided to replace it with majority gender Female, so it will not influence a lot at the all of data. In the column 'children' were weird values like 20 and -1. Analyzing the table I found impossible that people have 20 children in 21 years old, also -1 is not logical. Finding mean and median also brang no clean results, because median was 0 and it can impact on all of data if replace 20 children, also mean was 0.5 what was no good also. So I can assume that it was mistake and should be 2 and 1 children. Replaced 20 and -1 values with 2 and 1. Upon checking the 'children' column I noticed a value 0 in 'dob_years' column which is impossible. Calculating mean and median and decided to use median for replacement because mean was not integer value and we don't want float in our calculation.\n",
    "IN the column 'purpose' with the help of lemmatization I was able to group all purposes to 4 main categories. So I will be able to analize the credit score depending on purpose.\n",
    "After all preparation I've got a clean data for work. Upon analyzing I may assume that the lowest credit score have clients with kids and those who want to get a loan for buying a car or for education. Actually it does make sence, because family with kids need much more money for their everday needs, and this is extra expences for the family. About clients who want to take loan for education. I think the most of those clients are students, who don't have job experience yet, the most of them have unstable permanent job. Married clients I guess become more responsible after marriage and pay a little bit better then single. High income allows customers to feel a little be more comfident with payments and pay in time.\n",
    "Buying a car increases expences and this impacts on the credit score. Because car needs extra money\n",
    "Loan for wedding and estate have a low unpaid score because people who decided married and buy a house are more responsible.\n",
